Oxycodone may also cause severe constipation, which can lead to other serious problems. Do not use oxycodone if you have severe breathing problems, a blockage in your stomach or intestines, or if you have recently used alcohol, sedatives, tranquilizers, or other opioid medications. Do not use oxycodone if you are allergic to it or to other opioid medications, such as codeine, hydrocodone, or morphine. To use oxycodone safely, follow your doctor's instructions and the directions on the medication label. Do not take more or less oxycodone than prescribed, and do not take it more often than prescribed. Do not crush, chew, or dissolve the tablets. Swallow them whole. Oxycodone can cause side effects, including drowsiness, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, constipation, and headache. If you experience any of these side effects, talk to your doctor. Do not drink alcohol while taking oxycodone. Alcohol can increase the risk of serious side effects, including overdose and death. Do not drive or operate machinery while taking oxycodone. Oxycodone can impair your thinking and judgment. If you are pregnant or breastfeeding, talk to your doctor before taking oxycodone. Oxycodone can pass into breast milk and may harm a nursing baby. If you are taking oxycodone for a long time, your doctor may recommend that you take a lower dose of the medication over time to reduce your risk of addiction and other side effects. Do not stop taking oxycodone suddenly without talking to your doctor. Stopping the medication suddenly can cause withdrawal symptoms, such as anxiety, sweating, nausea, and vomiting. If you have any questions or concerns about oxycodone, talk to your doctor.'''\n",
