# Introduction
This project aims to test whether using MedLM for the automated summarization of structured and semi-structured medical data will lead to more efficient and accurate extraction of patient information. By creating comprehensive and concise summaries that capture essential details about a patient's medical history, current state, and treatment protocols, contributing to enhanced patient care and management.

# Data
2.3 million Radiology Reports and 40,000 patient care records of deidentified data.

### MIMIC-III
The dataset contains 26 tables of deidentified health-related data associated with over forty thousand patients who stayed in critical care units of the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center between 2001 and 2012. The database includes information such as demographics, vital sign measurements made at the bedside, laboratory test results, procedures, medications, caregiver notes, imaging reports, and mortality (including post-hospital discharge) . Of the 26 tables, five tables are used to define and another five tables are dictionaries for cross-referencing codes against their respective definitions with the remaining tables containing data associated with patient care, such as physiological measurements, caregiver observations, and billing information.

### MIMIC-IV
There are 4 tables in the dataset that can be grouped into two categories  discharge summaries and free text radiology reports associated with radiography imaging.  Discharge summaries are long form narratives which describe the reason for a patient’s admission to the hospital, their hospital course, and any relevant discharge instructions. Free-text radiology reports are semi-structured and usually follow a consistent template for a given imaging protocol.
